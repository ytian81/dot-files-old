- zshrc

- tmux.conf

- vimrc

__Note__:

1 use iTerm2 default Solarized dark theme. (Never use any other one, even Solarized-dark-patch, since it will make vim color scheme messy)

2 Disable iTerm2 - _draw bold text in bright color_

3 __PATH__ is not neatly concatnated by system. So set PATH manually to avoid overhead
